# sql-challenge

This is the repository that holds my Module 9 SQL-Challenge.

Module Overview: The challenge was divided into 3 parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
  • Data Modeling:  We were asked to review the 6 CSV files in the “Data_Resources” subfolder and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for each. 
  • Data Engineering: We were asked to use the info from the Data Modeling portion to create a table schema for each of the 6 CSV files. Also, we had to include data types, primary and foreign keys, and other constraints. Finally, we were asked to create composite keys as needed and create the tables in 
    the correct order to handle foreign keys.
  • Data Analysis. We were asked to answer the following 8 questions:
      1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
      2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
      3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
      4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
      5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
      6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
      7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
      8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

The “EmployeeSQL” folder contains the following subfolders:
•	“Data_Analysis”: Holds my  code, “Table Schema_Data Analysis”,  which contains my queries for the data analysis portion of this challenge. 
•	“Data_Engineering”: Holds my code,  “Table Schema_Data Engineering”, which contains my table schema creation for the data engineering portion of this challenge.
•	“Data_Modeling”: Holds a PNG of my ERD sketch and my code, “ERD_Table Schema, which contains the table schema created using Quick Database Diagrams.
•	“Data_Resources”: Contains the 6 csv files used for this challenge.

Please note, I used in-class activities/notes and the following resources to complete my assignments:
